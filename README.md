# 🚦 SmartLane AI – Intelligent Traffic & Emergency Vehicle Management System

**📅 Date:** November 16, 2025  
**🏁 Event:** TechXNinjas – PARANOX 2.0 (3-Month National Level Innovation + 24-Hour Build Hackathon)  
**👥 Team:** Team SourceCode  
**🌍 Live Demo:** https://paranox-sourcecode.hf.space  
**🧠 CNN Model Training Notebook:** https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1v-TD755AdnonZuIX0nXLbM2DvF281xiu?usp=sharing

## 🔥 About SmartLane AI

SmartLane AI is an **AI-powered Traffic Intelligence Platform** designed to optimize 4-way traffic intersections using:

🚘 **YOLOv8 Object Detection**  
🚑 **Multimodal Ambulance/Emergency Vehicle Detection**  
🎯 **CNN Deep Learning Classification**  
📊 **Real-Time Traffic Analytics & Signal Time Optimization**

It automatically prioritizes **emergency vehicles** (Ambulance) by extending green light duration and clearing the lane using a **multi-method decision model**:

| Detection Layers (Priority Order) |
|------|
| 1️⃣ Manual Override Control |
| 2️⃣ YOLO + Color Signature Analysis |
| 3️⃣ CNN Ambulance Classifier |
| 4️⃣ Red/White Pattern Recognition |
| 5️⃣ Emergency Text/OCR Pattern Detection |

---

## 🧪 Live Demo & Results

🔗 **Live Web App:** https://paranox-sourcecode.hf.space  
📌 Upload **four road images** (North, East, South, West) → SmartLane AI detects vehicle density and prioritizes emergency lanes.
